    <p> With the rapid development of technology, the increased prevalence of autonomy is not far away. From everyday objects like a coffee machine to more complex objects like cars, autonomy is becoming a more frequently explored concept to make our lives easier. Forecasting for a few years ahead, we realised the potential for an autonomous vehicle in the space of an international airport. In a team of two other designers, we embarked on a mission to make the experience within the international airport more enjoyable and more efficient for users. Through an intense semester, we managed to work through the design process and use key design thinking skills to develop <b>FriendBot</b>.</p>

    <p> FriendBot is an autonomous robot that we have designed to enhance travellers experience within airports. This bot greets travellers upon entering the airport, guides them through the security processes, and finally to the travellers' boarding gate. At this point, the FriendBot will provide the user with a range of convenient and entertaining services including food and duty free delivery.
    <br>
    <br>
    FriendBot aimed to resolve the key issues our users experienced within the airport. </p>
    <ul class="problems">
      <li> <b>WAYFINDING</b>
        <br>
        Travellers wanted to be able to navigate around the airport without having to rely on staff or other people
        </li>
      <li><b> NOTIFICATION </b>
        <br>
        Travellers wanted to be "in the know" when it comes to relevant delays and notifications
      </li>
      <li> <b>ENTERTAINMENT </b>
        <br>
        In general, travellers wanted to be entertained in the long stretches of waiting </li>

  <h3> The Process Taken </h3>
        <p>To achieve the final result, we used the design process to guide our actions and develop a strong foundation to build our concept upon. We first began with research to empathise with our users and figure out the key pain points and opportunity areas for us to work with. Through both secondary and primary research, our user needs became evident and allowed us to create a clear problem statement and issues we wanted to address with our concept.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, we entered the ideating stage of the process and developed three fleshed out concepts. We developed two of these concepts into paper prototypes and user tested. FriendBot went through several rounds of ideation within the paper prototype stage as we thought it would be important to flesh out the issues early on in the design process so that going forward, we knew our concept was heavily backed up with user testing. With positive feedback from user testing, we decided to go forward with FriendBot and develop our paper prototype into mid-fidelity wireframes to go through another round of user testing.</p>
        <p>With almost all the issues already addressed in the early stages of the testing, our wireframes and finally interactive prototype were very easy to navigate and had very positive feedback from users.</p>

  <h3> Development of FriendBot </h3>
 <p> The development of FriendBot was long and included several iterations at many stages in the design process. We came across many points where both feedback from user testing and our team brainstorming influenced the design decisions made when developing the user interface. We made a few key changes that greatly impacted the way users would interact with FriendBot. 
   </p>
 </div>
 </div>



 <div class="infosection2">
  <div class="centerblock centerblock3">
      <ul>
       <li><b>Language Selection</b>
         <br> 
         Since FriendBot was built to be used by people internationally, we decided to incorporate a language button in the navigation bar to allow users to choose their preferred language at any time. During our user testing of paper prototypes, we quickly came to learn that our users were not paying much attention to the navigation bar and rather, completely ignored it. 
         <br>
         Because of the importance of this fuctionality, we decided to make this the very first screen of our user interface so that users understand what the FriendBot is and how it can help. This was an important feature that many of our users recognised in later testing of wireframes where the ability to select a language was greatly valued for the FriendBot to be able to perform it's purpose.
       </li>
       <br>
       <li><b>Buzzer</b>
         <br> 
         For the food and duty free delivery, we recognised that there would need to be some sort of security measure in place to ensure that users 1) receive their orders and 2) can't desert their FriendBot without collecting their purchases.
         <br>
         To target this without raising any security issues technology such as biotech could raise, we incorporated a "buzzer" which the user would have to take while their FriendBot collects their purchase. This "buzzer" would act as a GPS for the FriendBot to know where their user is, and also act as a key so that users can "unlock" their purchases. 
       </li>
       <br>
       <li><b>User Interactions</b>
         <br> 
         When designing the interface, we had the issue of the "back" buttom being prevalent on each screen and at times becoming annoying for the user since, although they should always have the option to go back, it may not be the best time to do so. 
         <br>
         Therefore, we introduced a swipe right to go back to the previous screen that would allow users more advanced control if they needed it. We decided to familiarise this behaviour with users by using a brief instructional video that would show how to perform the action. 
       </li>
       <br>
       <li><b>Delay Notifications</b>
         <br> 
         To make FriendBot have a more solid notification system, we decided to implement users' delays and other notifications in the navigation bar of FriendBot. This way the user would only be made aware of the notifications that matter to them. We introduced a pop-up notification where the user will be interrupted whilst using the FriendBot, to have to read and acknowledge the notification. This notification will then remain alert on the nav bar so that users are reminded of the notification and have the freedom to view their alert again.
         <br> 
         This was a necessary change after many people in our wireframe testing ignored the notification, thinking it was unimportant or not relevant to them. 
       </li>

   <div class="infosection">
    <div class="centerblock centerblock2">
    <p> After an entire semester of developing the idea of FriendBot, I have learnt many things as a designer, the most important of which is to plan and frequently take a step back and evaluate where you are and the next logical steps you need to take going forward. Personally, this is the most valuable thing I have learnt and put into practice over the course of the project. There are many times within the entire design process where it is easy to feel overwhelmed - I felt this soon after gathering all the primary data. With the vast nature of pain points our users were experiencing, it was very easy to get lost in all of that information. I found it very important to stop, think about it, and develop "How Might We" questions to be able to structure not only my thoughts, but also the ideation that was to come. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Overall, it was a very intense project to work on, but I think by using the design thinking skills I have learnt in the Interaction Design Studio, and in the past two years of studying Design Computing, my team and I were able to develop a well thought out, useful and usable product. We thought outside the box when it came to autonomous device and made something that was not only efficient but also enjoyable for our users. We really took in what our users had to say from the very beginning and backed up each of our design decisions with those findings to ensure at the end of it all, FriendBot was what our users needed and would be easy for them to use.
