                <p>The FriendBot has many functionalities that aim to aid users at the airport and provide an experience that feels like you are in first class. After a small setup process, your bot will be personalised to you and will take you where you need to go. A simple scan of your passport will give your bot all the information it needs to guide you on the way. On your way to the gate feel free to browse stores with the FriendBot by your side. When you reach your gate, your personalised FriendBot will offer you a range of services to keep you occupied whilst waiting for your plane to board:
                </p>
                 
                <p class="indent"><b>1. FOOD AND DUTY FREE SERVICES</b></p>
                <p class="indent"> Have your food and duty free shopping delivered directly to you through your FriendBot with barely a lift of a  finger. Simply browse through a list of food options and shops within the airport and order anything you like. Your FriendBot will go, collect your purhcases and store it securly so only you can receive it. Experience the entire airport without moving from your seat.</p>
                <br>

                <p class="indent"><b>2. MOVIES & GAMES </b></p>
                <p class="indent">Browse through our range of newly released movies to keep you entertained. If not, FriendBot also has an extensive range of games that will keep you or your kids occupied for long periods of time.</p>
                <br>

                <p class="indent"><b>3. NOTIFICATION SYSTEM</b></p>
                <p class="indent"> You will not have to worry about timing your activities to the boarding of your flight. Your FriendBot will automatically know when your plane is boarding and will alert you 5 minutes before you must board. Your FriendBot will also provide you with alerts of key delays that are personalised to you so you are informed about what matters.</p>
                <br>

                <p class="indent"><b>4. WAYFINDING SYSTEM</b></p>
                <p class="indent"> Prior to arriving at your gate, the FriendBot's main fuctionality is to guide the user to their gate. The bot meets users upon the entrance of the airport and, should they choose to employ the services of the bot, it will guide them through the key processes of the airport in a personalised manner.</p>
                <br>

                <p>After going through two rounds of user testing, once with paper prototypes and a second time with medium-fidelity wireframes, we had ample feedback and direction to begin the next fidelity of prototyping. We gathered quite positive feedback from our users with only a few small aspects that needed to be changed and enhanced when moving forward with the interactive prototype. Scroll through to follow our journey of prototyping and testing to deliver a highly optimised user interface.</p>

            </div>
            <p> When testing our interactive prototypes, we decided to keep a similar structure and approach to our testing of both the paper prototypes and the medium fidelity wireframes. We decided to only do one round of testing for the interactive prototypes because of time restrictions and also the fact that our user testers for the wireframes had very few changes issues. For us, this was a good sign that the concept and usability of the FriendBot interfaces were intuitive. 
              <br>
              <br>
            User testing was an important next step in the prototyping and testing stages on the design process. We needed to see how our potential users would interact and engage with our interactive prototype as it would be the closest to the final product as we can get it at this stage.</p>

                      <p> We decided to conduct semi-structured interviews during and after our user testing sessions. We wanted to conduct interviews as it would be a good foundation to get qualitative data from our users so from there, we could extract user needs and frustrations. However, the very structured and organised formation of interviews meant that we wouldn't be able to ask our users questions based on their words and actions. Therefore, we decided that the a semi-structure interview would best suit the function of user testing. We often asked our users more probing or explanatory questions based on the feedback and thoughts they gave us. This was followed by a few set questions to get some concrete quanitative data but also qualtitative data based on users' experiences. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      At the end of each user testing session, we asked the following questions to gather specific data:
                      <p class="indent">1. How would you rate the usability on a scale of 1-5? How easy was it to use?</p>
                      <p class="indent">2. Would you actually use this product in a foreign airport and/or local airport?</p>
                      <p class="indent">3. Would you use the product to find your way or for the other services it provides?</p>
                      <p class="indent">4. Were the notifications regarding boarding times helpful in deciding how to spend your time? </p>
                      <p class="indent">5. Did you find the interactions within the prototype (swipes to go back for example) intuitive?</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                      <p>We also decided to utilise the think-aloud method so that we could get a better understanding of our users' thoughts whilst they were performing the tasks we put forward to them. The think-aloud method was good in getting a direct insight into what our users were thinking when they were interacting with our interactive prototype so we could easily tell where points of confusion where and the aspects which they liked. 
                        <br>
                      However, when using the think-aloud method for user testing, it's important to remember that people not always say what they actually think. Therefore we did not solely rely on this method for our user testing research but rather used it in tandem with other methods to support each other and make our findings more valid.
                      <br> 
                    To record our think-aloud findings, we either recorded the session or took notes of the key points the user expressed. We then sifted through the data and organised it into categories of what our users thought was helpful, what was confusing and what was lacking.</p>

                      <p>The final methodology we used when conducting the user testing sessions for our interactive prototypes was observation. We used observation alongside the think-aloud method since we thought the two methods would particularly validate each other. With the observation method, we watched our users' behaviour and noted down any signs of confusion, hesitation and/or questionning to get the most accurate results from our user testing. By focusing on the actions and facial expressions of the user, we were able to get a better understanding of what they were really feeling in the moment, and were able to compare this data with the think-aloud they were providing as well. </p>

              <h3>WHO DID WE CONDUCT OUR SESSIONS WITH?</h3>
              <p>Gathering and testing on appropriate users is a very important aspect of conducting user research sessions. Our target audience for FriendBot could be considered quite diverse. We wanted this concept to be valuable for people of all ages and in all different situations. Our core stakeholders included:</p> 
              <p class="indent">+ Travellers</p>
              <p class="indent">+ Immigrants</p>
              <p class="indent">+ Tourists</p>
              <p class="indent">+ Large groups</p>
              <p class="indent">+ Parents</p>
              <p class="indent">+ Young Adults</p>
              <p class="indent">+ Business Travellers</p>
              <br>
              <p>We tried to test on the people who would be considered a part of our core stakeholders or people we thought would be the most relevant to test on. However, due to the timeline to complete these user tests, we only have the oppotunity to user test the FriendBot interface on three people. Despite this, we gathered valuable information that would help us in our final round of iteration. </p>

              <p>After conducting one round of user testing, we decided to collate and implement our feedback and test it on two more participants to see how the implementation of user testing had an impact on the usability of our user interface.

              <p>Due to the vast size and functionality of our interactive prototype, we decided to give our users two specific tasks to complete as part of the user testing session. We wanted to test the key services provided by the FriendBot since the functionality of these would be a good depiction of the functionality overall since there are some very similar screens. The two tasks we asked our users to perform were generally consistent throughout the different fidelities of prototypes since we wanted to see the areas for improvement in the main areas of wayfinding, food/shopping deliver and entertainment. </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Users noticed the red notification on the itinerary button but did not realise it's important and therefore did not bother to press it</li>

            <!-- JUSTIFICATION FOR CHANGES -->
            <p> After receiving the feedback from our first round of testing, our next steps in the prototyping and testing stage became evident. We would have to try to address the points of confusion that our users experienced as well as improve the usability of some aspects within the prototype. We made these few changes to the interactive prototype so that we could test a final improved version to a few more users.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>1. Red Notification Button</b></p>
                <p class="indent"> PROBLEM: Our users did not realise the itinerary button change colours or noticed and didn't realise it's importance.</p>
                <p class="indent"> SOLUTION: Our solution to this problem was to introduce a pop-up notification screen instead. This could pop-up at any time, depending on when the information becomes released. The user must acknowledge the notification to close it which ensures they read it before continuing their activity. However, if for some reason they want to revisit the notification, the red alert will remain alert to remind the user that there is some sort of delay. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                <p class="indent"><b>2. Back Button</b></p>
                <p class="indent"> PROBLEM: There was no back buttons so that users could have freedom when interacting with the FriendBot.</p>
                <p class="indent"> SOLUTION: Our solution to this problem was to introduce a swipe functionality to the FriendBot where all the user has to do is swipe right to be taken to the previous page. Majority of our users preferred having a the swipe functionality over a button due to the vast presence of this type of functionality in many touch screen interactions such as Facebook. This however, brought up an issue about how the user would know that they could swipe to go back, unless they experimented or accidentally did it. Therefore, we introduced a new screen after the language selection page that would briefly show the user how to swipe. Unfortunately, FramerX, the prototyping tool we used was unable to provide this functionality in our interactive prototypes.

           <p>To move forward in the design process, we made the above changes and did two more user testing sessions to get a general idea of how this increased usability and whether there was any other hidden issues with our interactive prototype.</p>
          

            <!--ROUND 2 OF TESTING -->
            <div class="summary-sub-heading"><h3> ROUND 2 </h3></div>
            <div class="sectioncontainer">
              <!-- POSITIVE FEEDBACK 2-->
              <div class="feedb" id="positive2">  
                <img src="./img/companion/heart.png" class="icons" alt="Heart Icon">
                <div class="infotext"><p> The positive feedback we received from the users in our second round of testing was largely similar to the feedback from our first round. However, there were additions since we had fixed the issues that our users had commonly faced in our first round of testing. Overall, the interaction with the prototype was very positive and the concept was largely well received. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Guidance and the map is great in particular for foreign airports </li>
                  <li>The walkthrough screen showing how to swipe back was good to know and would be very usable if it worked</li> 
                  <li>The simplicity of the screen was good to not overwhelm users</li>
                  <li>The interactions were very smooth and intuitive</li>
                  <li>Pop up confirmation screens were good pieces of information</li>
                  <li>Short animated videos were helpful in understanding what needed to be done</li>
                  <li>The ability to select from a variety of languages at the beginning of the process </li>
                  <li>Pop up screen of delay notification was great to know since flight details are the most important thing to be informed about</li> 
                </ul>
              </div>
              </div>

              <!-- MISSING 2-->
              <div class="feedb" id="missing2">
                <img src="./img/companion/warning.png" class="icons" alt="Exclamation Mark">
                <div class="infotext"><p> With the two participants in the second round of testing, only one of the users picked up a potential issue with swiping back till Throughout our user testing sessions, our users would sometimes point out some sort of functionality that they would like to see implemented in both the bot itself and also the interface. Between our four users, these two problems with the user interface were consistent: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A menu button would have been a good addition so that the user does not have to just keep swiping to go back to it</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              </div>
            </div>

            <h6>JUSTIFICATION</h6>

            <!-- JUSTIFICATION FOR CHANGES ROUND 2-->
            <p> After incorporting the feedback from the first round of testing, the users from round two had a very positive experience with our interactive prototype. All the major issues had been addressed and our users found it easy to navigate through the interface to achieve their tasks and also browse a little through the available screens. There was only one potential issue that was identified in this final round of user testing. </p>
                <p class="indent"><b>1. Menu Button</b></p>
                <p class="indent"> PROBLEM: One of our users was wondering if there was a more efficient way to get back to the menu rather then just continuously swipping back.</p>
                <p class="indent"> SOLUTION: Our solution to this problem is to introduce another swipe function where the user can swipe down on the screen to pull down a few options. On this screen the user can either go to the "Main Menu" that has all the buttons for the services the bot provides, and also there will be a "End Journey" button so that the user can easily terminate their journey at any point after you have reached your gate. To make the user aware as to how this swipe function would work, a new screen will be implemented before the menu screen which will show a short animation.</p>
